Example usage:\n *\n *   var Props = require('ReactPropTypes');\n *   var MyArticle = React.createClass({\n *     propTypes: {\n *       // An optional string prop named \"description\".\n *       description: Props.string,\n *\n *       // A required enum prop named \"category\".\n *       category: Props.oneOf(['News','Photos']).isRequired,\n *\n *       // A prop named \"dialog\" that requires an instance of Dialog.\n *       dialog: Props.instanceOf(Dialog).isRequired\n *     },\n *     render: function() { ... }\n *   });\n *\n * A more formal specification of how these methods are used:\n *\n *   type := array|bool|func|object|number|string|oneOf([...])|instanceOf(...)\n *   decl := ReactPropTypes.{type}(.isRequired)?\n *\n * Each and every declaration produces a function with the same signature. This\n * allows the creation of custom validation functions. For example:\n *\n *  var MyLink = React.createClass({\n *    propTypes: {\n *      // An optional string or URI prop named \"href\".\n *      href: function(props, propName, componentName) {\n *        var propValue = props[propName];\n *        if (propValue != null && typeof propValue !== 'string' &&\n *            !(propValue instanceof URI)) {\n *          return new Error(\n *            'Expected a string or an URI for ' + propName + ' in ' +\n *            componentName\n *          );\n *        }\n *      }\n *    },\n *    render: function() {...}\n *  });\n *\n * @internal\n */\n\nvar ANONYMOUS = '<<anonymous>>';\n\nvar elementTypeChecker = createElementTypeChecker();\nvar nodeTypeChecker = createNodeChecker();\n\nvar ReactPropTypes = {\n  array: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('array'),\n  bool: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('boolean'),\n  func: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('function'),\n  number: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('number'),\n  object: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('object'),\n  string: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('string'),\n\n  any: createAnyTypeChecker(),\n  arrayOf: createArrayOfTypeChecker,\n  element: elementTypeChecker,\n  instanceOf: createInstanceTypeChecker,\n  node: nodeTypeChecker,\n  objectOf: createObjectOfTypeChecker,\n  oneOf: createEnumTypeChecker,\n  oneOfType: createUnionTypeChecker,\n  shape: createShapeTypeChecker\n};\n\nfunction createChainableTypeChecker(validate) {\n  function checkType(isRequired, props, propName, componentName, location) {\n    componentName = componentName || ANONYMOUS;\n    if (props[propName] == null) {\n      var locationName = ReactPropTypeLocationNames[location];\n      if (isRequired) {\n        return new Error(\n          (\"Required \" + locationName + \" `\" + propName + \"` was not specified in \") +\n          (\"`\" + componentName + \"`.\")\n        );\n      }\n      return null;\n    } else {\n      return validate(props, propName, componentName, location);\n    }\n  }\n\n  var chainedCheckType = checkType.bind(null, false);\n  chainedCheckType.isRequired = checkType.bind(null, true);\n\n  return chainedCheckType;\n}\n\nfunction createPrimitiveTypeChecker(expectedType) {\n  function validate(props, propName, componentName, location) {\n    var propValue = props[propName];\n    var propType = getPropType(propValue);\n    if (propType !== expectedType) {\n      var locationName = ReactPropTypeLocationNames[location];\n      // `propValue` being instance of, say, date/regexp, pass the 'object'\n      // check, but we can offer a more precise error message here rather than\n      // 'of type `object`'.\n      var preciseType = getPreciseType(propValue);\n\n      return new Error(\n        (\"Invalid \" + locationName + \" `\" + propName + \"` of type `\" + preciseType + \"` \") +\n        (\"supplied to `\" + componentName + \"`, expected `\" + expectedType + \"`.\")\n      );\n    }\n    return null;\n  }\n  return createChainableTypeChecker(validate);\n}\n\nfunction createAnyTypeChecker() {\n  return createChainableTypeChecker(emptyFunction.thatReturns(null));\n}\n\nfunction createArrayOfTypeChecker(typeChecker) {\n  function validate(props, propName, componentName, location) {\n    var propValue = props[propName];\n    if (!Array.isArray(propValue)) {\n      var locationName = ReactPropTypeLocationNames[location];\n      var propType = getPropType(propValue);\n      return new Error(\n        (\"Invalid \" + locationName + \" `\" + propName + \"` of type \") +\n        (\"`\" + propType + \"` supplied to `\" + componentName + \"`, expected an array.\")\n      );\n    }\n    for (var i = 0;
